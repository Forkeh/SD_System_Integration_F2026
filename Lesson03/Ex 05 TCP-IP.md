### TCP/IP

1. Inspect your computer's local ports and sockets using `netstat`
    
    - `netstat -a` shows active and listening TCP connections and UDP ports
    - `netstat -s` displays statistics for TCP, UDP and other protocols like IP and ICMP
    - `netstat -f` shows FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names) for the foreign addresses local sockets are connected to
