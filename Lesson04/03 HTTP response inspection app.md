### HTTP response inspection app
Using the backend programming language and/or framework of your choice, run an HTTP GET request on a public website and output each one of its parts:
- Status
- Headers
- Body. Limit it to 500 characters, as it could be massive

Try inspecting GET requests for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.
