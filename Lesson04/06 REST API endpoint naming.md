### REST Endpoint Naming
Imagine that you have a database with CVs whose design is based on the [CV XSD exercise](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_System_Integration_F26_Materials/blob/main/File%20Formats/Exercises/06%20CV%20XSD.md). You have to design a REST API based on this data.

Write down the names of the following REST endpoints:
- List CVs. Either the full list or filtered by:
  - Last name
  - Language
- Create a new CV
  
- Get a full CV
- Replace an entire CV
- Partially update a CV
- Delete a CV

- Get personal information for a CV
- Replace personal information for a CV
- Partially update personal information for a CV

- Retrieve the picture file name for a CV
- Update the picture file name for a CV

- Get all degrees for a CV
- Add a new degree to a CV
- Get one degree for a CV
- Replace a degree in a CV
- Delete a degree in a CV

- Logging in
- Logging out
