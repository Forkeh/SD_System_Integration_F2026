### To Do list
Write a REST API in the programming language of your choice that implements the following endpoints for a to do list:

- Retrieve all tasks
- Retrieve a task by ID
- Add a new task
- Edit a task by ID
- Delete a task by ID

Requirements:
- Responses will be served in JSON format
- Follow REST naming conventions
- Implement HATEOAS links

Create the corresponding requests in Postman or a similar API testing tool.

The following data structure can be used for testing:
```
[
    {"id": 1, "task": "Learn REST APIs", "done": False},
    {"id": 2, "task": "Build a REST API", "done": False},
    {"id": 3, "task": "Test the API", "done": False},
    {"id": 4, "task": "Keep learning", "done": False}
]
```
