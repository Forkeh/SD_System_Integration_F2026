### JSON and Text API Consumption
Write an application (front-end or back-end, with GUI or CLI) with the programming language(s) of your choice that implements the following functionality:
- Given a GitHub username, list all his/her repos
- Given a repo, list all its files
- Given a file, display its content

Use the two following APIs:
- [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28) (non-authenticated) for username, repo, and repo file information
  - E.g., https://api.github.com/users/arturomorarioja
- [GitHub Text API for file content](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/44370)
  - E.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arturomorarioja/customers_api/main/customers/customers.sql
