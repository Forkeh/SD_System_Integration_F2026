### Application Patterns

Work in groups of 5.

Match the following scenarios to the application pattern that best fits them (layered, onion, hexagonal, modular monolith, microkernel, CQRS, event sourcing):

1. **Product Catalogue**  
   Large e-commerce platform:
    - Writes (product updates) are rare and done by a small admin team
    - Reads (product browsing, search, filtering) happen millions of times per day
    - Read requirements differ significantly from write requirements (denormalised views, search indices)

    **_ANSWER:_** CQRS

2. **Booking System**  
   A flight and hotel booking platform built around a rich domain model (reservations, pricing rules, cancellations).  
   The company wants domain logic insulated from frameworks, UI, and database technology because they expect a migration from SQL to NoSQL in two years.

    **_ANSWER:_** Onion

3. **ERP Lite**  
   Medium-sized enterprise app with clearly separated domains: Inventory, Invoicing, HR, Scheduling.  
   All modules share the same codebase and database, but must enforce strict boundaries so that teams can work independently without committing to microservices.

    **_ANSWER:_** Modular Monolith

4. **Bank Ledger with Audit Trail**  
   A financial ledger must store not just account balances but a complete history of all changes.  
   Auditors require the ability to reconstruct the state at any moment in the past.  
   Corrections must be made as compensating transactions, never by editing data.

    **_ANSWER:_** Event Sourcing

5. **Webshop**  
   A standard webshop with predictable CRUD operations: list products, add to cart, place order, update user info.  
   Stable requirements, minimal complexity, classic front-end + business logic + data access setup.

    **_ANSWER:_** Layered

6. **Photo Editor with Plugins**  
   Users download a desktop photo editor with a solid core (loading/saving images, basic editing).  
   Most features (filters, effects, exporters) must be independent plugins that third-party developers can write and users can install dynamically.

    **_ANSWER:_** Microkernel

7. **Payment Adapter Hub**  
   A company must support many payment providers (Stripe, MobilePay, Klarna, PayPal).  
   Each provider has different APIs, authentication models, and workflows.  
   The business logic should not change when a provider is replaced.

       **_ANSWER:_** Hexagonal

### Solution

1. **Product Catalogue**  
   CQRS: different read/write models.
   
2. **Booking System**  
   Onion: explicit need to protect domain logic from infrastructure changes.
   
3. **ERP Lite**  
   Modular monolith: strong modules with internal boundaries, but one deployable unit.
   
4. **Bank Ledger with Audit Trail**  
   Event sourcing: it keeps an immutable log.
   
5. **Webshop**  
   Layered: 3 clearly separated layers.
   
6. **Photo Editor with Plugins**  
   Microkernel: the plugins are not independent, but they extend a core module. 
   
7. **Payment Adapter Hub**  
   Hexagonal: the domain logic owns ports that connect to each provider's adapter without modifying the application's domain logic.
