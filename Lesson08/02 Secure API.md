### Secure API

Work in groups of 4 or 5 students.

A team has developed a small API for a course project submission system. The API works functionally, but its security design is incomplete.

The system has four user roles:
- **Guest**: not logged in
- **Student**: can manage their own project submissions
- **Teacher**: can view and grade student submissions
- **Admin**: can manage users

The API currently exposes these endpoints:

|Method|Endpoint|Purpose|
|-|-|-|
|POST|`/login`|Log in|
|GET|`/projects`|List all project titles and descriptions|
|GET|`/projects/{id}`|View one project|
|POST|`/projects`|Create a new project|
|PUT|`/projects/{id}`|Update a project|
|DELETE|`/projects/{id}`|Delete a project|
|POST|`/projects/{id}/submit`|Submit work for a project|
|GET|`/submissions`|List submissions|
|GET|`/submissions/{id}`|View one submission|
|PATCH|`/submissions/{id}/grade`|Grade a submission|
|GET|`/users`|List users|
|POST|`/users`|Create a user|

Additional information:
- The API can currently be reached over both HTTP and HTTPS
- Failed logins return either Unknown username or Wrong password
- All logged-in users currently have access to all authenticated endpoints
- No rate limiting has been configured
- No request size limits have been configured
- Input validation exists only partially
- Logging has not yet been designed
- Security headers have not yet been chosen
- Password hashing is required, but not yet implemented

**1. Endpoint authentication**

For each endpoint, decide whether access should be:
- Public
- Authenticated. If affirmative, specify to which role(s) should access be restricted
  
#### Solution

|Method|Endpoint|Access|Role(s)|
|-|-|-|-|
|POST|`/login`|Public|N/A|
|GET|`/projects`|Public|N/A|
|GET|`/projects/{id}`|Public|N/A|
|POST|`/projects`|Authenticated|Teacher, Admin|
|PUT|`/projects/{id}`|Authenticated|Teacher, Admin|
|DELETE|`/projects/{id}`|Authenticated|Admin|
|POST|`/projects/{id}/submit`|Authenticated|Student|
|GET|`/submissions`|Authenticated|Teacher, Admin|
|GET|`/submissions/{id}`|Authenticated|Student (own submission only), Teacher, Admin|
|PATCH|`/submissions/{id}/grade`|Authenticated|Teacher|
|GET|`/users`|Authenticated|Admin|
|POST|`/users`|Authenticated|Admin|

**2. Access control**

Is RBAC sufficient for this API, or would ABAC be necessary?

#### Solution

RBAC is sufficient for the most part because most permissions map naturally to roles.

The exception is the endpoint `GET /submissions/{id}`, which requires something extra, e.g.:
- ABAC, introducing a simple attribute-based rule (e.g., `student_id == submission.owner_id`)
- RBAC with an ownership check

---
**3. Rate limiting**

The team decides to limit each endpoint to a maximum number of requests per minute per client with the following rate limiting criteria:
- Strict: 5 requests/minute
- Moderate: 30 requests/minute
- Relaxed: 120 requests/minute

1. Indicate which endpoint belongs in each of the three approaches
2. Which is the heaviest endpoint?

#### Solution

1. Endpoint classification

| Endpoint                        | Rate limit                 | Justification                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST `/login`                   | **Strict**                 | Sensitive to brute-force attacks; repeated attempts must be limited   |
| GET `/projects`                 | **Relaxed**                | Public read, low cost, high expected usage                            |
| GET `/projects/{id}`            | **Relaxed**                | Same as above                                                         |
| POST `/projects`                | **Moderate**               | Write operation; should not be spammed                                |
| PUT `/projects/{id}`            | **Moderate**               | Write operation|
| DELETE `/projects/{id}`         | **Strict**                 | Destructive operation; low expected frequency|
| POST `/projects/{id}/submit`    | **Strict**                 | File upload + processing; high resource cost|
| GET `/submissions`              | **Moderate**               | Potentially large dataset; more sensitive than public project listing |
| GET `/submissions/{id}`         | **Moderate**               | More sensitive than public project listing|
| PATCH `/submissions/{id}/grade` | **Strict**                 | Sensitive write; should not be repeated frequently|
| GET `/users`                    | **Moderate** | Sensitive data; should not be freely queried                          |
| POST `/users`                   | **Strict**                 | Account creation should be tightly controlled (abuse risk)            |

2. Heaviest endpoint

`POST /projects/{id}/submit`, as it not only implies storage and processing, but may involve file upload.
