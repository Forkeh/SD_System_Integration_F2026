### Secure API

Work in groups of 4 or 5 students.

A team has developed a small API for a course project submission system. The API works functionally, but its security design is incomplete.

The system has four user roles:
- **Guest**: not logged in
- **Student**: can manage their own project submissions
- **Teacher**: can view and grade student submissions
- **Admin**: can manage users

The API currently exposes these endpoints:

|Method|Endpoint|Purpose|
|-|-|-|
|POST|`/login`|Log in|
|GET|`/projects`|List all project titles and descriptions|
|GET|`/projects/{id}`|View one project|
|POST|`/projects`|Create a new project|
|PUT|`/projects/{id}`|Update a project|
|DELETE|`/projects/{id}`|Delete a project|
|POST|`/projects/{id}/submit`|Submit work for a project|
|GET|`/submissions`|List submissions|
|GET|`/submissions/{id}`|View one submission|
|PATCH|`/submissions/{id}/grade`|Grade a submission|
|GET|`/users`|List users|
|POST|`/users`|Create a user|

Additional information:
- The API can currently be reached over both HTTP and HTTPS
- Failed logins return either Unknown username or Wrong password
- All logged-in users currently have access to all authenticated endpoints
- No rate limiting has been configured
- No request size limits have been configured
- Input validation exists only partially
- Logging has not yet been designed
- Security headers have not yet been chosen
- Password hashing is required, but not yet implemented

**1. Endpoint authentication**

For each endpoint, decide whether access should be:
- Public
- Authenticated. If affirmative, specify to which role(s) should access be restricted
  
---
**2. Access control**

Is RBAC sufficient for this API, or would ABAC be necessary?

---
**3. Rate limiting**

The team decides to limit each endpoint to a maximum number of requests per minute per client with the following rate limiting criteria:
- Strict: 5 requests/minute
- Moderate: 30 requests/minute
- Relaxed: 120 requests/minute

1. Indicate which endpoint belongs in each of the three approaches
2. Which is the heaviest endpoint?
